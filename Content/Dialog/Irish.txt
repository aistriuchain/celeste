# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause
# {big}this text is large{/big}

# Gameplay Control Commands (should never change)

		{trigger 0 Madeline approaches}
		
		[THEO left normal]
		What a killer night for a hike!

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		I guess so.

		[THEO left normal]
		This place is so crazy. 

		[THEO left excited]
		I kind of can't believe it exists!

		[MADELINE right sad]
		Not the easiest climb, is it?

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		But I guess that's what I was looking for...
		
		[THEO left normal]
		Whoa, that sounds pretty serious.
		I'm just happy to see another{n}human in such a lonely place.

		[THEO left excited]
		I'm {+ theo} by the way, an adventurer from a {>> 0.3}{~}far off land!{/~}{>>}
		
		[MADELINE right sad]
		...{0.2}

		[THEO left thinking]
		Not much of a talker, are you?

		[THEO left normal]
		Mysterious lone wolf type, I get it.{n}I'll just imagine some dark backstory for you.

	CH1_THEO_B=
		[MADELINE right sad]
		Hey, sorry. I'm {+MADELINE}.
		I've got a lot on my mind.

		[THEO left normal]
		Well, {+MADELINE}, I'd say you've come to the right place!

		[THEO left thinking]
		I'm freezing my toes off, but I can't imagine{n}a better place to be for some quiet reflection.
		
		[MADELINE right sad]
		Yeah, maybe you're right.

		[MADELINE right normal]
		What "{>> 0.5}{~}far off land{/~}{>>}" do you hail from?
		
		[THEO left excited]
		Well, my inquisitive compatriot, I doth hail{n}from the {0.3}{~}mystical,{0.4} exotic{/~}{0.4} kingdom of...
		
		[THEO left normal]
		{0.4} Seattle.

		[MADELINE right normal]
		It sounds like a special place.

	CH1_THEO_C=
		[THEO left excited]
		This place is wild!

		[THEO left normal]
		Why would an entire city be abandoned?
		
		[MADELINE right normal]
		I read that some mega-corporation started{n}building it, but then no one wanted to live here.

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		I wonder why...
		
		[THEO left excited]
		My money's on a government cover-up.

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		What a waste, to build all of this for no reason...

		[THEO left normal]
		At least we get to enjoy the leftovers.

		[MADELINE right normal]
		Are you here to explore this city?

		Oh really? Cool!

		Thanks for the pie, {+MADELINE}.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		I'm impressed!
		This gives my baking a run for its money.

		[BADELINE left normal]
		Not bad.

		[THEO left excited]
		Holy crap!

		[THEO left normal]
		This is so tasty.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		{+MS_MADELINE}, are you available to{n}cater our re-opening banquet?

		Can I take a slice home for {+ALEX}?
		She'll die when she tastes this.

		This is the best thing I've ever tasted!

		Come on. Be honest.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		He's right, dear.
		This is delicious.

		It's truly magnificent, {+MS_MADELINE}.

		{~}A symphony for the taste buds!{/~}

		Can I take partial credit for this?

		Nice to see you again.

	APP_OLDLADY_B=
		[MADELINE left sad]
		What is this place?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		This passage leads to the center of the {+MOUNTAIN}.
		You said you wanted to come{n}back and explore deeper...

		{trigger 0 start laughing}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		Doesn't get any deeper than this!

		{trigger 1 stop laughing}

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Be careful, though.
		When you get this close to the heart of the {+MOUNTAIN},{n}its power will start affectin' you differently.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Yeah, I already noticed some of that...

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Good luck in there.

	APP_OLDLADY_C=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Where's that other {+PART_OF_YOU}?

		[MADELINE left sad]
		I don't know... I expected her to show up by now.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		Maybe I've changed, and{n}she's not {+PART_OF_ME} anymore.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Or maybe you've grown together.
		Maybe it's not so easy for the{n}{+MOUNTAIN} to separate you now.
		I'd wager she's still with you, in some form.

		[MADELINE left normal]
		I like that theory better.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I still wish I could talk to her though.

	APP_OLDLADY_D=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Do you keep in touch with {+THEO}?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah, he spent the summer in Vancouver.
		We got to spend some quality time together.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		What's he up to these days?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		He's back in California with his family now.
		He wants to be around while{n}his sister finishes law school.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		It sounds pretty intense, but he{n}wants to be there to support her.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		He seems like a nice young man.

	APP_OLDLADY_E=
		[MADELINE left normal]
		It's been a while. How've you been?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Oh, same old same old.

		{trigger 0 start laughing}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		And in my case, that's pretty old.

		{trigger 1 end laughing}

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I'm not gettin' any younger, that's for sure.
		Some days, just keeping the{n}lights on can take all my energy.
		The {+MOUNTAIN} still keeps me sharp, though.

		[GRANNY right mock]
		I'm not ready to give up the ghost anytime soon.

		[MADELINE left normal]
		I'd expect no less from you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Take care of yourself.

	APP_OLDLADY_LOCKED=
		[MADELINE left sad]
		That door up ahead won't budge.
		Is there another way in?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I'm afraid not, dear.

		[GRANNY right mock]
		You think the {+MOUNTAIN} is gonna{n}start going easy on you now?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I guess it doesn't think you're ready yet.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Okay, {+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} might be {~}weird and magical.{/~}

		[MADELINE left upset]
		But now you're telling me it can {~}"think",{/~} too?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		It doesn't think like you or me.
		It's like... how a river thinks to flow to the sea.
		You can make it sound crazy if you want.

		[MADELINE left upset]
		I know better than to doubt you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		How do I convince it I'm ready?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Heck if I know.
		I'd retrace my steps, and really pay attention.
		{+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} must have more to teach you.

	APP_ENDING=

		{+GRANNY}...
		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I can't believe you're gone, you old bat.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		Well,{0.2} I guess I can.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		It sounded like you were saying goodbye{n}in the last letter you sent me.

		{silent_trigger 0 Step Forward}
		
		[MADELINE left sadder]
		This isn't fair. I need you.

		[MADELINE left angry]
		You didn't prepare me for any of this.

		{trigger 1 Badeline Appears}

		[BADELINE left scoff]
		What do you want her to do, apologize?

		[BADELINE left upset]
		She's gone.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		And you didn't even go to the funeral.

		{trigger 2 Sit Down}

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I know, I just... couldn't.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I fell apart.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I'm so sorry, {+GRANNY}.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		{~}Sorry{/~} won't bring her back.

		[MADELINE left sadder]

		It was selfish of me to come here.

		[BADELINE right concerned]
		Where are we going, {+MADELINE}?

		[MADELINE left sad]
		We have to follow that bird.

		[BADELINE right worried]
		I thought it was just her pet or something...

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		It {~}has{/~} to be more than that.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		That bird was always looking out for me{n}on the {+MOUNTAIN}, just like {+GRANNY} did.

		[BADELINE right concerned]
		{+MADELINE}... I hate to say it, but...

		[BADELINE right worriedAlt]
		You're in denial.

		We should really turn back.

		We don't have time to argue about this.

		[BADELINE left concerned]
		How are you even breathing up here?

		[MADELINE right sad]
		{+GRANNY} wants us to follow her.

		[MADELINE right distracted]
		We can't let her down again.

		{~}...it's a bird,{/~} {+MADELINE}.

		You {*}really{/*} think that's just a regular bird?

		It's {+PART_OF_HER}, and it's still here somehow.

		[MADELINE right sad]
		I have to do... something.

		Are you testing me?

		Well, we don't need their help, right {+GRANNY}?

		Aren't you worried about getting lost up here?
