# NOTES:
# The # Symbol at the start of a line counts as a Comment. To include in dialog, use a \#
# The . Symbol will cause a pause unless escaped with \. (ex: Mr. Oshiro has a pause, Mr\. Oshiro does not)
# Newlines automatically create a Page Break, unless there is an {n} command on the previous line
# Commands: Anything inside of curly braces {...} is a command and should not be translated.

# Inline Text Commands:
# {~}wavy text{/~}
# {!}impact text{/!}
# {>> x}changes speed at which characters are displayed{>>}
# {# 000000}this text is black{#} (uses HEX color values)
# {+MENU_BEGIN} inserts the dialog from the MENU_BEGIN value (in English, "CLIMB")
# {n} creates a newline, without a page break
# {0.5} creates a 0.5 second pause
# {big}this text is large{/big}

# Gameplay Control Commands (should never change)
# {trigger x} this triggers an in-game event
# {anchor} controls the visual position of the textbox in-game

		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah, we did.
		It was incredible.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Beautiful, isn't it?

		[BADELINE left upset]
		I didn't think it would be worth it...

		[BADELINE left normal]
		But it totally was.

		Good evening, everyone.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		A little bird told me there was to be a party.

		Y'know, this is the first time I've seen{n}you outside that hotel of yours, {+OSHIRO}.
		I'm glad you made it.
		{+MADELINE} here is baking us a pie with all{n}of the strawberries she's been collecting.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		Oh, that's wonderful, {+MS_MADELINE}.

		[THEO right normal]
		I haven't had {# F94A4A}strawberry pie{#} since I was a kid.

		Don't get your hopes up, she's not much of a baker.

		You also said I wasn't a mountain climber.

		True.

		{trigger 3 Maddy Turns}

		I can't promise it'll live up to the hype, {+THEO}.

		So?

		[THEO left wtf]
		I guess this is technically a pie...

		Is this some kind of joke, {+MS_MADELINE}?

		Strawberry pies are supposed to{n}have strawberries in them, dear.

		[THEO left wtf]
		{+MADELINE}, I super appreciate you baking for us...
		But I don't think I can eat this.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		It's the thought that counts.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		You people just can't appreciate good food.
		I'll eat all of it myself.

		[MADELINE right sad]
		You don't have to do that.

		[BADELINE left worried]
		Yeah... it was an empty threat.

	EP_PIE_OKAY=
		[OSHIRO left normal]
		The important thing is that you{n}tried your best, {+MS_MADELINE}.

		[BADELINE left angry]
		Who invited this guy?

		[THEO left thinking]
		Come on, it's really good.

		[GRANNY left normal]
		I've certainly had worse.

		Thanks for the pie, {+MADELINE}.

		Holy crap!

		This is so tasty.

		[OSHIRO left normal]
		{+MS_MADELINE}, are you available to{n}cater our re-opening banquet?

		Can I take a slice home for {+ALEX}?

# *** Appendix ***

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Hey there, kiddo!
		Nice to see you again.

		{trigger 0}

		[GRANNY right normal flip]
		Here's the cave I told you about{n}on the phone.
		
		{silent_trigger 1}
		
		Follow me.

	APP_OLDLADY_B=
		[MADELINE left sad]
		What is this place?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		This passage leads to the center of the {+MOUNTAIN}.
		You said you wanted to come{n}back and explore deeper...

		{trigger 0 start laughing}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		Doesn't get any deeper than this!

		{trigger 1 stop laughing}

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Be careful, though.
		When you get this close to the heart of the {+MOUNTAIN},{n}its power will start affectin' you differently.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Yeah, I already noticed some of that...

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Good luck in there.

	APP_OLDLADY_C=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Where's that other {+PART_OF_YOU}?

		[MADELINE left sad]
		I don't know... I expected her to show up by now.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		Maybe I've changed, and{n}she's not {+PART_OF_ME} anymore.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Or maybe you've grown together.
		Maybe it's not so easy for the{n}{+MOUNTAIN} to separate you now.
		I'd wager she's still with you, in some form.

		[MADELINE left normal]
		I like that theory better.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I still wish I could talk to her though.

	APP_OLDLADY_D=
		[GRANNY right normal]
		Do you keep in touch with {+THEO}?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah, he spent the summer in Vancouver.
		We got to spend some quality time together.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		What's he up to these days?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		He's back in California with his family now.
		He wants to be around while{n}his sister finishes law school.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		It sounds pretty intense, but he{n}wants to be there to support her.

		[GRANNY right normal]
		He seems like a nice young man.

	APP_OLDLADY_E=
		[MADELINE left normal]
		It's been a while. How've you been?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Oh, same old same old.

		{trigger 0 start laughing}

		[GRANNY right laugh]
		And in my case, that's pretty old.

		{trigger 1 end laughing}

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I'm not gettin' any younger, that's for sure.
		Some days, just keeping the{n}lights on can take all my energy.
		The {+MOUNTAIN} still keeps me sharp, though.

		[GRANNY right mock]
		I'm not ready to give up the ghost anytime soon.

		[MADELINE left normal]
		I'd expect no less from you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Take care of yourself.

	APP_OLDLADY_LOCKED=
		[MADELINE left sad]
		That door up ahead won't budge.
		Is there another way in?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I'm afraid not, dear.

		[GRANNY right mock]
		You think the {+MOUNTAIN} is gonna{n}start going easy on you now?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		I guess it doesn't think you're ready yet.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		Okay, {+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} might be {~}weird and magical.{/~}

		[MADELINE left upset]
		But now you're telling me it can {~}"think",{/~} too?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		It doesn't think like you or me.
		It's like... how a river thinks to flow to the sea.
		You can make it sound crazy if you want.

		[MADELINE left upset]
		I know better than to doubt you.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		How do I convince it I'm ready?

		[GRANNY right normal]
		Heck if I know.
		I'd retrace my steps, and really pay attention.
		{+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} must have more to teach you.

	APP_ENDING=

		This isn't fair. I need you.

		[MADELINE left angry]

		She's gone.

		{trigger 2 Sit Down}

		I know, I just... couldn't.

		I fell apart.

		{~}Sorry{/~} won't bring her back.

		We have to follow that bird.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		Yeah yeah, I know you.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		I figured the funeral might've{n}triggered your anxiety, NBD.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		Next time, {~}at least{/~} just let me know you're still alive.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		You feeling any better?
		
		[MADELINE left sad]
		Yeah...

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		I'm finally starting to come to terms with it.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		When I first met {+GRANNY},{n}I thought she was crazy.

		[MADELINE left distracted]
		But then I got to know her...

		[MADELINE left upset]
		...and I thought she was mean.

		[MADELINE left sad]
		But she knew what I needed to hear,{n}and she really helped me.

		[MADELINE left sadder]
		I miss her a lot.
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		Yeah, me too.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		I honestly thought she'd live forever.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		Oh! That reminds me!{n}I have to show you something.
		
		[MADELINE left normal]
		Oh?
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		Remember how I told you my grandpa went{n}to {+CELESTE_MOUNTAIN} when he was younger?

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		Well, I was going through{n}some of his old stuff with {+ALEX}...
		And check out this photo I found.
     
 		{trigger 0 Shows the photo of Theo's grandpa with Granny at Celeste Mountain.}
 		
 		[MADELINE left surprised]
		Is that {+GRANNY}!? With your grandpa?

		[MADELINE left normal]
		{+THEO}, that's amazing!
		It looks like they were friends.
		
		[WEBCAM_THEO right excited]
		Just like us!

		[WEBCAM_THEO right thinking]
		It really sucks that they're gone.

		[WEBCAM_THEO right normal]
		But it's nice to know that we{n}shared the {+MOUNTAIN} with them.
		
		[MADELINE left normal]
		Yeah...

		[MADELINE left peaceful]
